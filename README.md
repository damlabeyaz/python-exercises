# python-exercises

This repository contains all programming examples from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-bootcamp/).

## Usage

Since I am at the beginning I started to write my codes with Jupiter Notebooks. I will transform them to normal Python files soon and then provide a better usage manual.
